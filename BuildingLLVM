We can build LLVM and clang from source.
The instructions are available at, for example,
  http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html

On some machines, you will need to have a more recent version of 
GCC to build LLVM and/or clang.  You can install this in your own
directory. You install GCC from source with, e.g.,
   configure  --prefix=$HOME/local
to install the resulting software into $HOME/local/{bin,lib}

When building LLVM with this new version of GCC, you should
add $HOME/local/bin to your PATH environment variable and
also include $HOME/local/lib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.

If the configuration for LLVM still fails with an error message
about the version of libstdc++ being insufficient, you can 
explicitly set the environment variables CC and CXX
to point to the fully qualified paths to gcc and g++, respectively, e.g.

  export CC=$HOME/local/bin/gcc
  export CXX=$HOME/local/bin/g++

Then re-run the configuration script for LLVM.
