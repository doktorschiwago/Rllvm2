\Abstract{ 

The \Rpkg{Rllvm} package is an \R{} interface to the Low-Level Virtual
Machine (LLVM).  This is a compiler toolkit for generating native code
for different computational devices (e.g. CPUs and GPUs).  These tools
in \R{} allow us to explore compiling both \R{} code and also
domain-specific languages (DSLs).  They also allow us to exchange code
with other systems using an intermediate representation of the native
code.  This paper describes the computational model and functionality
provided by \Rpkg{Rllvm} and illustrates these with examples of
low-level compilation.  We leave discussion of  more general
strategies for compiling \R{} code to \Rpkg{RLLVMCompile}.
